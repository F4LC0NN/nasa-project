# nasa-project

This project is a fullstack nodeJS web application.<br>
The idea is to schedule new launches for space exploration.

I followed the MVC model to structure the project.<br>
This allowed me to apply separate of concerns.

## Front-end

The front-end is built in ReactJS.

## Back-end

The back-end is built in NodeJS.<br>
Here are the other technologies I used:

- ExpressJS for the routing,
- MongoDB for the database,
- Mongoose for CRUD,
- Jest & Supertest for testing the network response,
- Csv-parse for loading the data from the .csv file,
- Axios for connecting to APIs.

## Deployment

I used Docker to bundle the web app.<br>
Then, I deployed it on AWS with EC2.
